GIT â€“ Branching Basics

1. Create a new branch:
   git branch branch_name

2. Switch to the branch:
   git checkout branch_name
   OR
   git switch branch_name

3. Create and switch in one step:
   git checkout -b branch_name
   OR
   git switch -c branch_name

4. Push new branch to remote:
   git push -u origin branch_name

5. View branches:
   git branch        (local)
   git branch -r     (remote)
   git branch -a     (all)

6. Delete a local branch:
   git branch -d branch_name

7. Delete a remote branch:
   git push origin --delete branch_name
